Definition
Replication involves copying data from one database server to another to improve availability and fault tolerance.

Types of Replication
1. Master-Slave Replication: Data is written to a master node and replicated to slave nodes.
Example Use Case: Read-heavy applications like analytics dashboards.

2. Master-Master Replication: Data can be written to multiple nodes, and all nodes are synchronized.
Example Use Case: Systems requiring high availability and write access.

Advantages
1. Ensures high availability and disaster recovery.
2. Enables load balancing for read operations.

Challenges
Managing replication lag.
Conflict resolution in master-master setups.
