Definition:
Partitioning involves splitting large datasets into smaller, manageable parts distributed across multiple servers.

Types of Partitioning
1. Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding): Dividing rows into smaller tables (shards) based on a key.
Example: Users with IDs 1–1000 in one shard, 1001–2000 in another.

2. Vertical Partitioning: Splitting tables into smaller ones by grouping columns.
Example: Separating frequently accessed columns from less accessed ones.

Advantages
1. Improves performance by reducing query load on individual servers.
2. Enhances scalability by distributing data.

Challenges
1. Handling cross-shard queries.
2. Maintaining data consistency.
