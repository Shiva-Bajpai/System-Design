Definition:
Reliability is the ability of a system to perform its intended function consistently and correctly, even in the face of failures.

Strategies for Ensuring Reliability:
Redundancy:

Duplicate critical components (e.g., servers, databases) to ensure backup in case of failure.
Example: Two database servers (primary and replica) to ensure no data is lost during a failure.
Fault Tolerance:

Designing systems to continue functioning even if some components fail.
Example: Netflix uses Chaos Engineering to test system reliability by deliberately causing failures.
Data Backups:

Regularly backup critical data to ensure recovery in case of disaster.
Example: A bank might back up transaction logs every hour.
Example:
Online Banking System: Users expect uninterrupted service even if one of the servers goes down. Redundancy ensures backup systems take over seamlessly.
