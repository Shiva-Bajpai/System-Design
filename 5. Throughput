Definition:
Throughput is the rate at which a system processes data or requests per unit time. It is usually measured in requests per second (RPS) or transactions per second (TPS).

## Key Factors Affecting Throughput:

1. Hardware Capacity: CPU, memory, and disk speed influence the systemâ€™s ability to process data.
Example: High-throughput systems often use SSDs and multi-core processors.

2. Concurrency: Ability of the system to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
Example: Thread pools in Java allow concurrent processing of tasks.

3. Bottlenecks: Any component (e.g., database) that limits the overall system throughput.
Example: A slow database query can reduce the throughput of a web application.

## Strategies to Improve Throughput:

1. Horizontal Scaling: Add more servers to distribute the load.
Example: Distribute database queries across multiple replicas.

2. Batch Processing: Group multiple requests and process them together.
Example: Payment gateways process transactions in batches during peak hours.

3. Queue Management: Use message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to handle high traffic.
Example: An e-commerce platform uses a queue to process millions of order requests during flash sales.

Example:
Payment Processing System: A payment gateway like PayPal needs to process thousands of transactions per second. Using distributed servers and message queues ensures high throughput.
