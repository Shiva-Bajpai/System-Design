Definition
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that provide flexibility in data storage and retrieval. They support unstructured or semi-structured data.

Types of NoSQL Databases
Document Stores: MongoDB (stores data as JSON-like documents).
Key-Value Stores: Redis (data stored as key-value pairs).
Column-Family Stores: Cassandra (data stored in a columnar format).
Graph Databases: Neo4j (stores relationships as graphs).
Features
Flexible Schema: No rigid schema, allowing dynamic data structures.
Scalability: Designed for horizontal scaling.
High Performance: Optimized for fast reads and writes.
Examples
MongoDB:

Stores data in JSON-like documents.
Example Use Case: Content management systems with flexible data models.
Cassandra:

Distributed, fault-tolerant database.
Example Use Case: Social media platforms requiring high availability.
When to Use
Applications requiring high scalability (e.g., real-time analytics).
Systems handling semi-structured or unstructured data.
