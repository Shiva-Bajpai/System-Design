Definition
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that provide flexibility in data storage and retrieval. They support unstructured or semi-structured data.

Types of NoSQL Databases
1. Document Stores: MongoDB (stores data as JSON-like documents).
2. Key-Value Stores: Redis (data stored as key-value pairs).
3. Column-Family Stores: Cassandra (data stored in a columnar format).
4. Graph Databases: Neo4j (stores relationships as graphs).

Features
1. Flexible Schema: No rigid schema, allowing dynamic data structures.
2. Scalability: Designed for horizontal scaling.
3. High Performance: Optimized for fast reads and writes.

Examples
1. 2MongoDB: Stores data in JSON-like documents.
Example Use Case: Content management systems with flexible data models.

2. Cassandra: Distributed, fault-tolerant database.
Example Use Case: Social media platforms requiring high availability.


When to Use
1. Applications requiring high scalability (e.g., real-time analytics).
2. Systems handling semi-structured or unstructured data.
