Definition:
A reverse proxy is a server that intercepts client requests and forwards them to backend servers. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the application server.

Functions of a Reverse Proxy:
1. Load Balancing: Distributes traffic to backend servers.
Example: Nginx is often used as a reverse proxy to balance traffic across application servers.

2. Caching: Stores responses for frequently requested content.
Example: A reverse proxy caches product images for an e-commerce website.

3. Security: Hides the IP addresses of backend servers, reducing the attack surface.
Example: Protects the application server from direct attacks.

4. SSL Termination: Manages HTTPS encryption and decryption.
Example: The reverse proxy terminates SSL traffic and forwards it to backend servers over HTTP.

Example:
Web Application Firewall: A reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy protects a web application by filtering malicious traffic before it reaches the backend servers.
