Definition:
A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

Types of Firewalls:
1. Network Firewalls: Operate at the network layer to block unauthorized traffic.
Example: Blocks traffic from known malicious IP addresses.

2. Application Firewalls: Operate at the application layer to filter HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
Example: Filters SQL injection attempts in web requests.

3. Stateful Firewalls: Tracks active connections and only allows traffic for legitimate sessions.
Example: Blocks unsolicited traffic while allowing responses to outgoing requests.

Firewall Rules:
1. Allow Rule: Permits specific traffic.
Example: Allow SSH traffic from trusted IPs.

2. Deny Rule: Blocks specific traffic.
Example: Block all incoming traffic except HTTP and HTTPS.

3. Rate Limiting: Limits the number of requests from a specific IP.
Example: Mitigates DDoS attacks by rate-limiting traffic.

Example:
Corporate Network: A company uses a firewall to block access to unauthorized websites and protect sensitive data from external threats.
