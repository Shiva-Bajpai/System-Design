Definition:
Auto-scaling is the process of dynamically adjusting the number of resources (e.g., servers) based on the current system load.

How It Works:
Monitors metrics like CPU usage, memory, or request rate.
Automatically adds more servers during high traffic (scaling out) and removes them during low traffic (scaling in).

Benefits:
1. Cost-efficient: Allocates resources only when needed, reducing costs during idle times.
2. Handles unpredictable traffic spikes without manual intervention.
3. Ensures consistent performance during high demand.

Challenges:
1. Complex configuration to define scaling policies and thresholds.
2. Latency during scaling: New servers take time to launch and configure.
3. Over-scaling or under-scaling can occur if thresholds are poorly defined.

Example:
1. E-Commerce Sale Event (e.g., Black Friday):
2. During peak hours, the system automatically adds 50 servers to handle millions of orders.
3. After the sale, unused servers are terminated to save costs.

Real-World Use Case:
1. AWS Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts EC2 instances based on demand.
2. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Provides auto-scaling for Kubernetes clusters.

When to Use:
1. Applications with fluctuating traffic patterns (e.g., gaming, e-commerce).
2. To minimize operational costs and ensure consistent performance.
