Definition:
A load balancer is a device or software that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It improves system availability, reliability, and performance.

Types of Load Balancers:
1. Layer 4 Load Balancer: Operates at the transport layer (TCP/UDP).
Example: Distributes traffic based on IP address and port.

2. Layer 7 Load Balancer: Operates at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS).
Example: Routes requests based on URLs, headers, or cookies.

Strategies Used:
1. Round Robin: Distributes requests sequentially across servers.
Example: First request goes to Server 1, second to Server 2, and so on.

2. Least Connections: Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
Example: Useful for chat applications where connections stay open for longer periods.

3. IP Hash: Maps clients to specific servers based on their IP address.
Example: Ensures the same client connects to the same server (session persistence).

Example:
E-commerce Website: During sales, a load balancer distributes traffic between multiple web servers to handle millions of users simultaneously.
