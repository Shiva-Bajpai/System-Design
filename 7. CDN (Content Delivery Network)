Definition:
A Content Delivery Network caches and delivers static assets (like images, videos, CSS, and JavaScript files) from servers located geographically close to users. This reduces latency and improves loading speeds.

How CDNs Work:
1. Edge Servers: Cache static assets at multiple locations worldwide.
Example: A video streamed in the US is served from a nearby server in California.

2. Origin Server: The original server where content is hosted.
Example: If content is not available on edge servers, the request is forwarded to the origin server.

Benefits:
1. Reduced Latency: Content is delivered faster due to proximity.
2. Lower Bandwidth Costs: Reduces the load on the origin server.
3. Improved Availability: Even during high traffic, CDNs handle requests efficiently.

Example:
Streaming Services: Netflix uses CDNs to cache videos in multiple regions, ensuring smooth streaming for global users.
