Definition:
Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increased workload by either adding resources or making better use of existing resources without significant performance degradation.

Types of Scalability:
Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up):

Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server.
Example: Upgrading from a 4-core CPU to an 8-core CPU on a database server.
Pros: Simple implementation, no changes in architecture.
Cons: Limited by hardware capacity and can become expensive.
Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out):

Adding more servers to distribute the load.
Example: Adding more web servers behind a load balancer to handle high traffic.
Pros: Virtually unlimited scalability, redundancy.
Cons: Complex architecture, requires changes in application design.

Example:
Imagine an e-commerce website like Amazon. During peak sales events (e.g., Black Friday), traffic spikes.
Vertical Scaling: Upgrade the database server to handle more transactions.
Horizontal Scaling: Add multiple application servers to balance the load and ensure smooth user experience.
