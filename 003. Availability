Definition:
Availability is the percentage of time a system remains operational and accessible to users.

Formula:
Availability (%) = Uptime / Uptime + Downtime × 100 

Strategies for High Availability:
1. Load Balancers: Distribute traffic among servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.
Example: AWS Elastic Load Balancer ensures traffic is spread across multiple servers.
Failover Mechanism:

2. Automatically switch to a backup system if the primary system fails.
Example: A backup server takes over if the main server crashes.

3. Replication: Maintain multiple copies of data or services in different regions.
Example: Cloudflare’s distributed servers ensure website availability even during regional outages.

Example: 
Video Streaming Platform: Users expect uninterrupted video playback. A failover mechanism ensures smooth streaming if one server goes down.
