Definition
SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in a structured format using tables with rows and columns. They follow a predefined schema and enforce relationships between tables.

Features
1. Schema-Based: Rigid schema ensures data integrity.
2. ACID Compliance: Ensures transactions are processed reliably.
3. Relational Model: Data is stored in tables with defined relationships.

Examples 
1. MySQL: Open-source and widely used for web applications. This supports replication, partitioning, and indexing.
Example Use Case: Online stores for managing product inventory and customer data.

2. PostgreSQL: Advanced SQL database with support for JSON, custom data types, and full-text search.
Example Use Case: Financial systems requiring complex queries and high reliability.

When to Use
Applications requiring strict consistency (e.g., banking systems).
Systems with a clear relational data structure.
