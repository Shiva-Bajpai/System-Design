Definition:
Sharding is a technique for distributing data horizontally by dividing it into smaller, independent chunks (shards) that are stored across multiple servers.

How It Works:
1. Each shard contains a subset of the data and handles requests for that subset.
2. Shards can be based on a specific attribute, such as user ID or geographic region.

Benefits:
1. Improves performance by reducing the load on individual servers.
2. Enables horizontal scaling of databases.
3. Isolates failures: If one shard fails, only a portion of the data is affected.

Challenges:
1. Complex to implement and manage.
2. Cross-shard queries are difficult and may lead to performance issues.
3. Rebalancing shards (adding or removing) is challenging as data needs to be redistributed.

Example:
* Social Media Platform (e.g., Instagram):
1. User data is distributed across shards based on user ID. For example:
2. Users with IDs 1-1,000,000 are stored in Shard A.
3. Users with IDs 1,000,001-2,000,000 are stored in Shard B.

Real-World Use Case:
MongoDB: Supports sharding natively for large-scale applications.

When to Use:
1. For large databases where a single server cannot handle all the data.
2. Applications with clearly partitionable datasets.
